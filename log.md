# 100 Days Of Code - Log from Phillip Nunes

#### From the movie: Javascript, React and Everything - Coming soon to Theaters.

### Day 1: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I decided that i need to learn React and improve my Javascript - ES6/ES7...ES9000+. I'll start by creating a Hacker News clone using their API.

**Thoughts:** Create React App seems to make work easier, but maybe this has a price (I still don't know). With some sort of "magic" and commands I made some progress, but i need to spend less time thinking about what to do and just do...JUST DO IT!

### Day 2: August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to iterate a component and how to write in markdown.

**Thoughts:** I found it a bit difficult to hit the amount of parentheses in the react, but I managed to end up with a very tight syntax in the loop.
