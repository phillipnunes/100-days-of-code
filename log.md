# 100 Days Of Code - Log from Phillip Nunes

#### From the movie: Javascript, React and Everything - Coming soon to Theaters.

### Day 1: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I decided that i need to learn React and improve my Javascript - ES6/ES7...ES9000+. I'll start by creating a Hacker News clone using their API.

**Thoughts:** Create React App seems to make work easier, but maybe this has a price (I still don't know). With some sort of "magic" and commands I made some progress, but i need to spend less time thinking about what to do and just do...JUST DO IT!

### Day 2: August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to iterate a component and how to write in markdown.

**Thoughts:** I found it a bit difficult to hit the amount of parentheses in the react, but I managed to end up with a very tight syntax in the loop.

### Day 3: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I tried to use fetch API, but afterward I finished with axios. I was able to pass some simple data between two components.

**Thoughts:** I started using the fetch API, but for simplicity in error management, I chose [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) .

### Day 4: August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finished the necessary requests to show data in component, and I formated the url size.

**Thoughts:** I still do not know the best way to make two concurrent requests. Did I do it right?

### Day 5: August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I learned a bit about async/await and promises, and some problems you have when working with asynchronous things.

**Thoughts:** I need to stop trying to refactor things to early, without knowing exactly where and how i will refactor. Before I do, I need to understand what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.

### Day 6: August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I Learned how to use components Link, Route and BrowserRouter from React Router, and I refactored links to use route component.

**Thoughts:** I had some progress with React Router, but I have a lot to learn about this tool.

### Day 7: August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I created the logic of pagination and added a component called react-paginate. The pagination is almost complete, just need some css and check for some side effects in my code.

**Thoughts:** I thought it would take longer in pagination, but my performance was better than I imagined :)
